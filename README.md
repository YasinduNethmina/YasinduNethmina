I am Yasindu, a 17-year-old self-learned Blockchain-Engineer that is very active & helping others in any way I can. I want to work with real projects that make a huge impact on everyone's life, especially for the future with Web3 technology and crypto integration.

I learned how to value time and how to make something very impressive in my journey very well.

Here are the things that I am good and very familiar with:

• Solidity

• React

• JavaScript

• HTML

• CSS

• Truffle

• Hardhat

• Web3

• Crypto & NFTs

• Game Engines (Unreal)

Also, I'm very good at working with teams, and currently working with a small game development company called MonkeyEmpire (15+ team) for more than a year developing a crypto-based game for the web3 community. I really believe in supporting and collaborating with other seniors and all the team members is to finish the project is very efficient and useful.

Which role currently I'm looking for:

I am searching for a Blockchain Engineer Junior or an Intern role that pushes me to grow as a developer and the ability to collaborate with a team to produce wonderful products. I'm still new and learning things every day to grind up my knowledge because Web3 technology is very new for everyone.

I really love to share my journey with others and If you are looking for someone who loves to learn new things, travel, crypto, and Web3 technology, contact me at yasindunethmina1938096@gmail.com

I cannot wait to hear from you!
